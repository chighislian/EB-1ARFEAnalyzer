Section1.Dr.DoeisanalienofextraordinaryabilityinOrganometallicChemistry,which
has been demonstrated by sustained national and international acclaim. Dr. Doe’s
accomplishments are extensively documented.
1.1Dr.Doe isanexpert in the fieldofOrganometallicChemistrywithover fiveyearsof
research experience in the exact area of proposed employment.
Dr. Doe started his research career in the field of Organic Chemistrywhen hewas an
undergraduatestudentatAStateUniversity,Anycountry(2002–2007).Hisundergraduatethesis
wasdevotedtothesynthesisofanalogsof steroidandtriterpenoidnaturalproductspossessing
antiangiogenicproperties.HewasalsoavisitingsummerstudentattheXStateUniversity,U.S.
in2006when just in2.5monthsheperformedaresearchworkthat resultedinafirst-author
scientific publication on the synthesis of heterocyclicmolecules, aminobenzo[d​]thiophenes.
They can be precursors for pharmaceutical substances. He later obtained his Ph.D. degree
working on N-heterocyclic carbene-borane complexes in 2011. Then he was offered a
postdoctoral fellowpositionat theUniversityofD,whereheapplieshisknowledgeofOrganic
andOrganometallicChemistrytothedesignofmetalloenzymecatalysts. (PleaseseeExhibit1,
CV of Dr. John Doe​.)
1.2 Other scientists recognize Dr. Doe’s extraordinary knowledge of Organometallic
Chemistry and consider Dr. Doe a top expert in the field.
Dr.Doe’s international recognitionisevident fromthe9letterssupportinghispetitionthathe
received fromninedistinguishedprofessors fromfourcountries. (SupportingLetters;Exhibits
2–10​.)Amongthem, thereareaMemberof theU.S.NationalAcademyofSciencesProf.Eand

Section2. Dr. Doe’s proposed employment has both substantialmerit andofnational
importance for the United States.
2.1 Organometallic Chemistry is an area of intrinsic merit.
Dr.JohnDoeintendstoworkinthefieldofOrganometallicChemistry. In2010,hepresenteda
poster about his research at theGResearchConference inOrganometallicChemistry. The
description of the conference provides a summary of the importance of Organometallic
Chemistry for the modern society:
“Becauseof itsdistinctpositionat the interfaceof twomajorareasofchemicalscience, inorganicand

United States

January 10, 2012

Myname isJohnDoe. Iamthebeneficiaryof theI-140ImmigrantPetitionforAlienWorker,
seekingEB-1Aimmigrant classificationasanindividualofextraordinaryability. Ihaveavast
experienceinOrganicandOrganometallicChemistryandI intendtocontinuedoingresearchin
these areas in the United States.
After finishingmy postdoctoral project at theUniversityofD, I plan topreparea research
proposal based onmy expertise and apply for academic positions in the U.S. research
universities.Over last tenyears, Ihavebeenexceptionallygoodinlearningnewthings,solving
challengingproblems,andpresentingmyresultstothescientificcommunity.Iliketeachingand
I likedoingresearch,sothepositionofanassistantprofessor inChemistrysuitsthebest tomy
interests and expertise.
GettingthepermanentresidenceintheUnitedStateswillincreasemyresearchopportunities.For
example,manyresearchgrantsandfellowshipsarerestrictedtotheU.S.citizensandpermanent
residents. IwillbeabletoattendinternationalconferencesinmyfieldoutsidetheUnitedStates
withoutworryingaboutgettinganewvisastamp.Forexample,asafinalistoftheRRPhDPrize,
Iwas invitedtotheconferenceinSomeland(Exhibit30,aninvitationletter​)withallexpenses
coveredbyorganizers.However, Ihadtodeclinethisimportantopportunitytointeractwithmy
colleagues becausemyU.S. F-1 entrance visa stamphadexpired.Renewing itwouldhave
required travelling tomy home country andwould have distractedme frommywork in
laboratory for several weeks.
Themodernsocietyandcurrent fundingsituationinphysicalsciencesrequirescientiststoshow
entrepreneur skills. Professors whoweremy advisors in graduate school and duringmy
postdoctoral stayhaveco-foundedstart-upcompanies focusedonthecommercializationof the
reagents that they had discovered. Prof. C is a co-founder ofXYZ Inc. andProf. E is a
co-founder of LMN, Inc.
Thus, as analternativebusinesscareer, Iconsider startingmyowncompany. Iamespecially

difficult to start my own business while I am in a non-immigrant visa status.

myexperienceallowsme toprofessionallyevaluate theworkofDr. JohnDoewhosemajor

Ihavenot interactedwithDr.Doedirectlybesidesmeetinghimonceattheresearchconference,

ThesepaperscoverdiversechemistryofN-heterocycliccarbene-boranecomplexes.Firstofall,
complexationof boraneswithN-heterocyclic carbene led to isolationandcharacterizationof
previously inaccessible reactive boron species: boron cations, anions and radicals. These
